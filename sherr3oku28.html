<h1 data-label="195240" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>In recent years, there has been an increasingly rapid advance in the field of machine-learning which led to a large influence on business planning and business strategy for almost all industries.&nbsp; Machine-learning has been used to help companies and organization conduct better decision makings in a data-scientific manner.&nbsp; There are numerous challenges to decision makings due to an&nbsp;aggressive and uncertainty of market behavior in the business environment&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{zhao_sales_2017}</cite>.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; a fashion industry that has production plants in Asian countries may need to decide the production plans long before&nbsp;<span>the accurate information of future demand is available. Sales forecasting is one of the technologies that utilize machine-learning to solve these challenges. A Sales forecast predicts the future value of sales over a period of time.&nbsp; It is a highly complicated problem due to the influence of internal and external environments. Thus, the forecast accuracy becomes a key aspect of sales forecasting. Inaccurate forecasts may lead to stock-outs or overstock inventories which affects&nbsp;the efficiency of the business decision and even result&nbsp;in losses for the companies&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Beheshti_Kashi_2014}</cite><span>.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; sales forecasting is an increasingly important part of the success and performance of companies.&nbsp;</span></div><div>Sale forecasting mainly depends on past historical sales data. Past historical sales data are classified as a time series data. Tak-chung Fu (2010) defined time series as sets of data points which takes into account of temporal ordering&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fu_2011}</cite>.&nbsp; Because of the time series characteristic,&nbsp; sales forecasting widely use traditional time series analysis methods which are based on&nbsp;mathematical and statistical models. Exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and regression models are examples of statistical approach in sales forecasting.&nbsp; In statistical time series analysis&nbsp;approach, it assumes that the time series data is linear. The traditional statistical approach is not suitable for real-world data due to an&nbsp;occasional outlying observation and asymmetric cycles characteristic, especially in sales&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hyndman1998}</cite>.&nbsp; More recent approaches based on machine learning techniques such as&nbsp;artificial neural networks are applied extensively in sales forecasting due to an extremely promising performance in the areas of control, prediction and pattern recognition&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sun_2008}</cite>.&nbsp; In Xia and Wong&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Xia_2014}</cite>,&nbsp; the authors reported that the approach based on intelligence techniques including neural&nbsp;networks, fuzzy systems, and hybrid models perform better in real-world data than statistical approach intelligence based sales forecasting methods did not assume the linear relationship between input and output of the data.&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp;intelligence-based sales forecasting methods&nbsp;are good at approximate nonlinear patterns which often appear in most real-world data.</div><div>The artificial neural&nbsp;networks method is one of the intelligence-based sales forecasting methods is extensively applied in sales forecasting&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sun_2008,Choi_2014,Guo_2016,Pan_2013,Vhatkar_2016}</cite>. Recent studies demonstrated that artificial neural networks can approximate any continuous function and&nbsp;have been successfully used for forecasting of time series data<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{oancea_time_2014}</cite>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Sales forecast vary in different fields depending on the business and managerial function. Some businesses have short life cycles, high variance of product and uncertainty of demands such as franchisees. Short-term&nbsp;sales forecast can help them adjust the right inventory level and makes the company more competitive as well&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Du_2015}</cite>. This thesis will primarily focus on the short-term sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div>
